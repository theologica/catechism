*The Catechism of the Council of Trent was directed to all priests. The recently released* Catechism of the Catholic Church *was directed to all bishops. The* Catechism of Pope St. Pius X *is that pope's partial realization of a simple, plain, brief, popular Catechism for uniform use throughout the whole world. In other words it is directed to the layman. It was used in the ecclesiastical province of Rome and for some years in other parts of Italy. It was not, however, prescribed for use throughout the universal church.*
