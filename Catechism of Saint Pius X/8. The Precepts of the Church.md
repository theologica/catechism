###### Q9. Why does the Church recommend the faithful to assist at the Parochial Mass?

###### Q11. Why in the First Precept of the Church is special mention made of the Lord's day?

*A.* In the First Precept of the Church special mention is made of the Lord's Day, because it is the principal Christian festival, as the Sabbath was the principal Jewish festival, and because it was instituted by God Himself.

*A.* The Church has instituted Feasts of our Lord, of the Blessed Virgin, of the Angels and of the Saints.

###### Q13. Why did the Church institute other Festivals of our Lord?

###### Q14. And why have Festivals of the Blessed Virgin and of the Saints been instituted?

*\[The universal law of the Church reckons ten Holydays of obligation: the feasts of Christmas, the Circumcision, the Epiphany, the Ascension, Corpus Christi, the Immaculate Conception, the Assumption, St. Joseph, Sts. Peter and Paul, and All Saints (CIC 1917: Can.1247; CIC 1983, Can. 1246). In many countries, by local concessions, they are reduced.\]*

###### Q21. For what purpose has Lent been instituted?

###### Q24. Why has fasting on Vigils been instituted?

###### Q25. What is forbidden on Fridays, and also on Saturdays where not dispensed?

*A.* On Fridays, and also on Saturdays where not dispensed, it is forbidden to eat meat, except in case of necessity.

###### Q26. Why does the Church wish us to abstain from eating meat on these days?

*A.* In order that we may do penance each week, and especially on Friday, in honour of the Passion, and on Saturdays in memory of the burial of Jesus Christ, and in honour of the Blessed Virgin.

*\[From the Code of Canon Law of 1917, with the modifications approved in 1949, (complete) abstinence only is to be observed on all the Fridays throughout the year. Fast and (complete) abstinence is to be observed on Ash Wednesday, the Fridays of Lent, Ember Fridays, the Vigils of the Assumption and Christmas, and Holy Saturday. Fast only (and partial abstinence) is to be observed on: all weekdays of Lent, Ember Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the Vigils of Pentecost and All Saints.*

*On the days of fast, only one full meal is allowed. Two other meatless snacks, sufficient to maintain strength may be taken according to each one's needs, but together they should not equal another full meal. Meat may be taken at the principal meal on a day of fast except on the days of complete abstinence. Eating between meals is forbidden, but liquids including milk and fruit juices are allowed.*

*On holydays of obligation, except in Lent, there is neither fast nor abstinence.*

*The laws of abstinence binds all who have completed their seventh year of age; the law of fasting binds all persons from the completion of their twenty first year until the beginning of their sixtieth. (The completion of the seventh year means the day after the seventh birthday).*

*According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, "All Fridays through the year and the time of Lent are penitential days and times throughout the universal Church. Abstinence from eating meat . . . is to be observed on Fridays throughout the year unless they are solemnities; abstinence and fast are to be observed on Ash Wednesday and (Good) Friday. All adults who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence; all adults (from age 18) are bound by the law of fast up to the beginning of their sixtieth year." The Episcopal Conference can modify these general rules.*

*In the United States, "Catholics are obliged to abstain from the eating of meat on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays during the season of Lent. They are also obliged to fast on Ash Wednesday and on Good Friday. Self-imposed observances of fasting on all weekdays of Lent is strongly recommended. Abstinence from flesh meat on all Fridays of the year is especially recommended to individuals and to the Catholic community as a whole."*

*In Australia, "Abstinence from meat, and fasting, are to be observed on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. On all other Fridays of the year the law of the common practice of penance is fulfilled by performing any of the following: (a) prayer, as for example Mass attendance, family prayer, . . . (b) self-denial, e.g. not eating meat, not eating sweets or dessert, . . (c) helping others, e.g. special attention to someone who is poor, sick, elderly, . . ."*

*Since a clarity and precision in a law helps for its fulfilment, the faithful are strongly recommended to follow the traditional rules, though only the recent regulations oblige under pain of mortal sin.\]*

## The Third Precept of the Church

###### Q27. What does the Church command us in the words of the Third Precept: To go to Confession at least once a year?

*A.* By the words of the Third Precept: To go to Confession a least once a year, the Church obliges all Christians, who have come to the use of reason, to approach the sacrament of Penance at least once a year.

###### Q28. What is the best time to satisfy the precept of annual Confession?

*A.* The best time to satisfy the precept of annual Confession is Lent, in accordance with the usage introduced and approved by the whole Church.

###### Q29. Why does the Church say that we are to confess at least once a year?

*A.* The Church uses the words at least to let us see her desire that we should approach the sacraments more frequently.

###### Q30. Is it useful, then, to go often to Confession?

*A.* It is most useful to go often to Confession, especially as it is difficult for one who goes only rarely to make a good Confession and to avoid mortal sin.

###### Q31. What does the Church command us to do by the other words of the Third Precept: To receive Holy Communion at Easter, each one in his own parish?

*A.* By the words of the Third Precept: To receive Holy Communion at Easter, each one in his own parish, the Church obliges all Christians who have come to the age of discretion to receive the Blessed Eucharist every year at Paschal time in their own parish.

###### Q32. Are we bound to go to Holy Communion at other times besides Easter?

*A.* We are also bound to go to Holy Communion when in danger of death.

###### Q33. Why is it said that we are to receive Holy Communion at least at Easter?

*A.* Because the Church earnestly desires us to approach Holy Communion which is the divine food of our souls, not only at Easter, but as often as we possibly can.

###### Q34. Is this Precept fulfilled by a sacrilegious Confession or a sacrilegious Communion?

*A.* This Precept of the Church is not fulfilled by sacrilegious Confession and Communion, because the intention of the Church is that we receive those Sacraments for the end on account of which they were instituted, that is, for our sanctification.

## The Fourth Precept of the Church

###### Q35. How are we to observe the Fourth Precept: To contribute to due support of the Church?

*A.* The Fourth Precept is satisfied by paying the dues or making the offerings which have been established in recognition of God's supreme dominion over all things and as a means of providing for the becoming support of His ministers.

###### Q36. How are these dues and offerings to be paid?

*A.* They are to be paid in the way and manner customary in the place in which we live.

## The Fifth Precept of the Church

###### Q37. What does the Church forbid in the Fifth Precept: Not to solemnise marriage at forbidden times?

*A.* In the Fifth Precept the Church does not forbid the celebration of the sacrament of marriage; but only the nuptial solemnities, from the first Sunday of Advent until the Epiphany, and from the first day of Lent until Low Sunday.

###### Q38. What are the nuptial solemnities which are forbidden?

*A.* The nuptial solemnities forbidden by this Precept are the celebration of the nuptial Mass, the nuptial benediction, and marriage festivities on a large scale. 

###### Q39. Why are marriage festivities on a large scale out of place in Advent and Lent?

*A.* Pompous displays are out of place in Advent and Lent because these seasons are specially consecrated to penance and prayer.
