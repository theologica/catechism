## Acknowledgments

All credit to the original authors, editors, and the church. As it was said by Pope Benedict XVI:

> Beginning in his years as parish priest, he \[Pope Pius X\] himself had compiled a catechism and during his Episcopate in Mantua he worked to produce a single, if not universal catechism, at least in Italian. As an authentic Pastor he had understood that the situation in that period, due partly to the phenomenon of emigration, made necessary a catechism to which every member of the faithful might refer, independently of the place in which he lived and of his position. As Pontiff, he compiled a text of Christian doctrine for the Diocese of Rome that was later disseminated throughout Italy and the world. Because of its simple, clear, precise language and effective explanations, this "Pius X Catechism", as it was called, was a reliable guide to many in learning the truths of the faith.


Thanks to EWTN for the full text of the Catechism of Saint Pius X, which I translated to Markdown.
